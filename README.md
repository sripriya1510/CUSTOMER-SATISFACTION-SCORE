# CUSTOMER-SATISFACTION-SCORE
    The project aims to build a real-time customer feedback collection and satisfaction prediction system using an AI chatbot. It collects open-ended feedback using natural language processing (NLP), analyzes the sentiment, predicts a customer satisfaction score, and identifies churn risk using machine learning models.
